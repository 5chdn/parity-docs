Markdown already supports code samples both inline (using single backticks like \`some code here\`) and in blocks. **Infusion** will syntax highlight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you provide the correct language in the formulation of the block.

So, this&hellip;

{{<codeBlock>}}
```html
&lt;button aria-pressed="false">toggle me&lt;/button>
```
{{</codeBlock>}}

&hellip; will result in this:

```html
<button aria-pressed="false">toggle me</button>
```

Note that the syntax highlighting uses a greyscale theme. **Infusion** is careful not to use color as part of its own design, because these colors may clash with those of the design being illustrated and discussed.

To preserve the wrapping inside code blocks, horizontal scrolling is implemented. To make sure scrolling is keyboard accessible, code blocks are focusable. An `aria-label` is provided to identify the code block to screen reader users.
